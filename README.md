# Challenges we ran into
Overall the development issues were mostly related to the lack of docs and integration issues.
Some of the issues that we faced are:-

Lack of documentation surrounding 1Inch APIs.
Lack of proper bridging and faucet services.
Weird TypeScript issues

# Bounties
1. 1Inch - Utilized the 1Inch fusion API to execute trades.
2. Alliance DAO - AlgoCombo is a onchain automated algo trading platform which aims to be a pioneer in this field.
3. Scroll - We implemented our data storage and trade functionality on sepolia scroll and using sushiswap.
